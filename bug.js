This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This is common when using asynchronous operations like fetching data from an API. Before the data has been fetched, the state might still be `null` or `undefined`, leading to the error.  For instance, consider the following code:
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* Error here if data is null */}
    </View>
  );
}
```
Attempting to access `data.name` before the `setData` function has been called will result in an error because `data` is still `null`.
